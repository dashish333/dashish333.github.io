<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io). -->

I'm currently engaged with [Strand](strandls.com) as a Software Development Engineer (ASE-I R&D). Before joining the firm, I was enrolled in the Master's programme at [IIT, Gandhinagar](https://www.iitgn.ac.in/) with *Computer Science & Engineering* as major. During this period, I was fortunate to have worked under esteem researcher/scientist [Prof. Anirban Dasgupta](https://sites.google.com/site/anirbandasgupta), where we focused on building *Coresets for solving $\ell_1$-Regression*. <br/>
Before joining IIT, my engagement was with Accenture for a time period of ~2 years, i.e. from 2014-2016. This whole engineering background has been established back during the period of 2010-2014 while I was pursuing my Bachelor's with major in *Computer Science & Engineering* at [JUET](https://www.juet.ac.in/). 

Beside all of this, I really prefer coffee, a physics discussion, and coding sessions.
